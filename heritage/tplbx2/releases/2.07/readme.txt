1. Introduction


LockBox is a cross-platform toolkit for data encryption. It contains
routines & components for use with Borland Delphi, C++Builder, &
Kylix. It provides support for Blowfish, RSA, MD5, SHA-1, DES, triple-
DES, Rijndael, & digital signing of messages.

This is a source-only release of TurboPower LockBox. It includes
designtime and runtime packages for Delphi 3 through 7 and C++Builder
3 through 6.

3. Installation


To install TurboPower LockBox into your IDE, take the following steps:

  1. Unzip the release files into a directory (e.g., d:\lockbox).

  2. Start Delphi or C++Builder.

  3. Add the source subdirectory (e.g., d:\lockbox\source) to the
     IDE's library path.

  4. Open & install the designtime package specific to the IDE being
     used. The IDE should notify you the components have been
     installed.

     a. For C++Builder 6 and Delphi 6 or higher, install the VCL
        design-time package (e.g., LxxxVDxx.*) when using LockBox
        classes with VCL applications.

     b. For C++Builder 6 and Delphi 6 or higher, install the CLX
        design-time package (e.g., LxxxCDxx.*) when using LockBox
        classes with CLX applications.

  5. Make sure the PATH environmental variable contains the directory
     in which the compiled packages (i.e., BPL or DPL files) were
     placed.
